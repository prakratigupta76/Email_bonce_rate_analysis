## Summary of Findings

- The bounce rate in **May** increased to **0.27%**, more than double the rate from surrounding months.
- The domain **centrum.sk** accounted for **~31% of all bounces** in May.
- The most frequent bounce reason was **SMTP code 554** (permanent failure).
- These patterns suggest domain-specific blocking or sender reputation issues.

## Tools & Techniques Used

- **Excel**: For data transformation, pivot tables, slicers, and charts.
- **Power Query**: To unpivot and structure the dataset.
- **SMTP Code Categorization**: To distinguish success, soft bounces, and hard bounces.
- **Bounce Rate Calculation**: Total bounces / total emails sent, by month.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Clean email list**: Suppress invalid or high-risk addresses (especially from centrum.sk).
- **Review sender reputation**: Investigate domain reputation and spam triggers.
- **Implement email warmup**: Gradually increase send volume to build ISP trust.
- **Contact affected ISPs**: If blacklisting or filtering is suspected.
